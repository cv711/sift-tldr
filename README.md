This Sift gives you an estimation on how long it will take you to read an email. This is a polished version of the Sift we started building to accompany our [Build it, Use it, Share it](https://medium.com/redsift-outbox/build-it-use-it-share-it-c6fd7936ba4f) blog post.

## Social coding
We like pull requests. If you want to fork it, add your own functionality, run it on your own data  and share it with the world, that's also cool. 
Find out how to become a Sift developer at [redsift.com](https://redsift.com) and check out our [docs](https://docs.redsift.com). 
Red Sift is and will always be free for developers to create and run Sifts.
